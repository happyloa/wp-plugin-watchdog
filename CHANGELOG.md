## [1.8.2] - 2026-09-11

### Changed

- Update WordPress compatibility to 7.1.
- Verify the packaged plugin with an activation and notification-free scan on WordPress 7.1 in CI.

### Fixed

- Match exact released versions in changelog headings instead of similarly numbered versions or prereleases.
- Recognize heading levels 2 through 6 and inline heading markup without including unrelated entries.
- Skip versioned changelogs that have no matching release instead of reporting an unrelated security fix.
- Add eight regression cases for changelog version matching.

## [1.8.1] - 2026-08-02

### Changed

- Filter WPScan vulnerability records against each installed plugin version and isolate caches by version.
- Require a genuine `POST` for the external Cron REST endpoint, reject method overrides, and accept the generated secret through the `X-Watchdog-Cron-Key` header or a Bearer token.
- Keep legacy query-key authentication available for existing `POST` jobs while no longer placing secrets in newly generated endpoint URLs.
- Clarify the WordPress.org plugin-slug lookups that are required for public version and changelog comparisons.

### Fixed

- Stop reporting WPScan vulnerabilities whose `fixed_in` version is already installed.
- Honor the WPScan rate-limit and temporary-server-error cooldown before sending additional API requests.
- Replace the non-working external Cron example with an authenticated request.
- Remove the hard-coded TLS verification override from the local Cron fallback.
- Add regression coverage for vulnerability filtering, API cooldowns, and Cron authentication.
- Refresh development-only PHPUnit and WordPress Coding Standards dependencies to patched releases.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-07-18

### Changed

- Refresh plugin metadata and compatibility declarations for WordPress 7.0.
- Move service construction and lifecycle hooks into a dedicated bootstrap.
- Separate platform message formatting from notification transport and retry handling.
- Schedule the first scan in the background instead of making activation depend on remote services.
- Align Slack, Discord, and Microsoft Teams webhook payloads with their current platform limits and formats.
- Use WordPress safe HTTP requests for outgoing webhooks.
- Cache WordPress.org plugin information and isolate failures to the affected plugin during scans.
- Refresh the admin dashboard with overview cards, sticky section navigation, responsive settings, and guarded form submissions.
- Extract risk sorting into a focused, independently tested service.

### Added

- Add a new Watchdog icon and responsive WordPress.org banner set with reproducible asset tooling.
- Add a distribution ignore manifest so development files and directory artwork stay out of installable packages.
- Add a reproducible Windows release builder with WordPress-compatible ZIP paths and a Traditional Chinese TortoiseSVN release guide.
- Regenerate the translation template for every 1.8.0 admin and notification string.

### Fixed

- Contain bootstrap failures so an incomplete or corrupted installation cannot take down the rest of the site.
- Validate every enabled notification channel and disable invalid settings instead of failing silently.
- Add save-and-test actions for Email, Discord, Slack, Teams, and custom webhooks.
- Redact webhook secrets from delivery errors and logs.
- Preserve the previous saved report when a scan provider fails instead of replacing data or aborting the request.
- Register recurring schedules on `init` to avoid early translation loading notices on WordPress 6.7 and newer.
- Preserve the external Cron secret across requests and upgrades so configured scheduler URLs remain valid.
- Run continuous integration across PHP 8.1 through PHP 8.5.
- Replace direct debug logging with a structured `site_add_on_watchdog_diagnostic` action for safe extensibility.
- Use WordPress URL and text sanitization helpers consistently.
- Add the official WordPress Plugin Check to continuous integration.
